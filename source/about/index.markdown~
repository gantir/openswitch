Hi, my name is Ben Gray though throughout most of the interwebs I go by my alias: frotzed.  This blog has been a lot of things over the years.  It started out as a religious blog, morphed into a personal blog and now is a *mostly* technical blog.  I'm addicted to learning and pushing myself to master new technologies.

Currently living in the metro area of Atlanta, Georgia I fill my free time by hanging out with my wife and two boys, writing on Openswitch and finding new and interesting ways I can break computers.

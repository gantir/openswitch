While I agree in that there&#8217;s an awful lot of hype, I can understand why people love this game and become addicted to it.  I just finished my first Su Do Ku puzzle and I found it to be brain candy.  Of course, I love number and logic puzzles anyway so I&#8217;m very biased toward Su Do Ku-like puzzles.

I&#8217;ve tried in the past to do crossword puzzles but I would always give up on them.  They were just too hard for me.  Furthermore, I would have to ask other people for the answers to almost every clue and that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s supposed to work.  I&#8217;ve found Su Do Ku puzzles to be much easier for me as well as more enjoyable.  While crosswords would take me 3-4 days to finish I can finish a Su Do Ku puzzle in about an hour.  The rules are simple:  Fill in the grid so that every row, every column, and every 3 &#215; 3 box contains the digits 1 through 9.  The puzzles aren&#8217;t difficult to solve, they just take some time.

Give Su Do Ku a try, you may find that despite the hype it&#8217;s a lot of fun.

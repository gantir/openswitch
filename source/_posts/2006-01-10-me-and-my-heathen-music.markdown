I think I&#8217;m a little different than most ministers in regards to my musical taste.  I get the impression that most ministers listen mostly, if not only, to &#8220;Christian&#8221; music.  But before I go on, let me define my terms.  Aside from the fact the whole &#8220;Christian/Secular&#8221; dichotomy is a false one and music itself can neither be &#8220;Christian&#8221; nor &#8220;Secular&#8221; I will use the terms &#8220;Christian music&#8221; and &#8220;Secular music&#8221; as they are commonly used because they are convenient and well known.

I don&#8217;t listen to Christian music all too much.  I think that on the whole mainstream Christian music is just not up to snuff when compared with secular music.  There are probably a number of reasons for this; there are more non-Christians making music than there are Christians, for example.  To give credit where credit&#8217;s due, there are a few Christian bands that really do it for me.  <a title="Link to Casting Crowns web site" href="http://castingcrowns.com/">Casting Crowns</a> is great, in my opinion.  So are <a title="Link to Switchfoot's web page" href="http://switchfoot.com/">Switchfoot</a> (review coming as soon as I purchase their new CD) and <a title="Link to Delirious web site" href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/">Delirious</a>.  But Christian bands like these are few and far between.  Not only that, they&#8217;re extremely hard to find out about in the first place because most Christian radio stations are still stuck in the 80s playing Michael W. Smith and Petra.

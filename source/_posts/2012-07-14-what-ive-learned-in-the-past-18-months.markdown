A year and a half ago I stepped into the world of professional IT support and I've had the time of my life ever since.  There is no other job on earth that I could enjoy more at this point than working full time with technology and people.  As you'd expect, the learning curve from youth pastor to computer technician has been fairly steep and not without its own set of challenges.  Let's talk about some of what I've learned these past 18 months.

## Define the problem

Once you accurately understand the problem you're halfway to finding the solution.  And when I say, "understand the problem" I don't mean "the computer is broken."  Anyone can tell you the computer doesn't work right.  But as soon as you know why it's not working correctly, discovering the solution will shortly follow.

## Divide and conquer

First determine if the problem is hardware or software.  Personally I find it easiest to rule out hardware first.  For instance, if a computer can't connect to the internet via an ethernet cable the first thing I'll do is fire up my laptop and plug in physically into the same ethernet cable that the faulty machine is using.  If my laptop gets online just fine, I can be sure the issue lies within the faulty computer.

At that point I'll continue to divide the problem further until I reach the conclusion and resolve the issue.

## Frustration is good, use it

There are two kinds of people in this world.  The first kind encounter a problem, get frustrated and quit trying to solve it.  The second kind get frustrated which makes them dig deeper into the problem.  The key to solving the issue is taking that emotion and channeling it toward the task at hand.  Don't give up!

## Research is essential 

At one point in computing history it was possible to learn all you needed to know from books published by the software or hardware manufacturers.  Today that is no longer true.  The sheer breadth of the computer market means that it's literally impossible to know everything about every piece of hardware and software.  Never stop learning.

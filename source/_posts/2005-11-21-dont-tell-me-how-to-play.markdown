One of the most endearing things about being a dad is watching my son play.  Seeing the smile on his cute little face as he accomplishes some new feat can&#8217;t be topped.  But you know what quenches that feeling a little?  Knowing that I&#8217;ve bought him hundreds of dollars worth of toys and he chooses to play with a dish and his high chair.  I mean, I&#8217;ve bought all those &#8220;smart baby&#8221; toys, you know the ones.  They&#8217;re supposed to make your kid smarter, smarter and well, smarter.  Some good they do when kids don&#8217;t want to play with &#8216;em.  I think for Christmas I&#8217;m going to get him a box and a bucket.  In all seriousness though, I really don&#8217;t mind that he chooses to play with simple objects as opposed to complex gadgets.  What that says to me is that he has a vivid imagination and prefers to not be told how to play.

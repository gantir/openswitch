Let me say it again, God cannot do anything.  Many people think that God can do absolutely anything, anything at all, and will cite Matthew 19:26, &#8220;&#8230;with God all things are possible&#8221; as their proof-text.  Well, aside from the fact that proof-texting is a horrible way to locate truth in Scripture, that verse is taken completely out of context when it&#8217;s used in that way.  Contextually it&#8217;s referring to the salvation a person.  Without God it would be impossible for anyone to be saved but with Him it is possible.  But I&#8217;m not here to refute bad hermeneutics because regardless of the meaning of this verse many people will still erroneously believe that God can do anything.  The fact is, He can&#8217;t.

No, God can&#8217;t do anything.  He can only do that which logically has the capability of being done.  For starters, God cannot sin.  He can&#8217;t, it would be a contradiction to His core nature.  Similarly, God can&#8217;t lead someone else to sin.  We know this from Scripture (James 1:13.)  So already we see that there are indeed some things that God cannot do.  Now that we&#8217;ve admitted this fact, let&#8217;s go a little further.

God cannot do anything that would be logically contradictory.  For instance, God cannot create a square circle.  This would be a logical contradiction, it does not have the capability of being done.  It&#8217;s at this point that people usually object to my stance by pointing out something like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s logically contradictory for someone who was dead to be raised from the dead.&#8221;  The problem is that it&#8217;s <em>not </em>a logical contradiction.  It goes against the natural order of things, but it is not illogical.  An example of something that is illogical is for someone to be alive and dead at the same time.  There&#8217;s a fine, but sharp, line that separates non-logic and going against the natural order of things.  Do you see the difference?

So while we know that God is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent and all those other &#8220;omni&#8217;s&#8221; let us consider the reassuring fact that God will never change.  He will never do anything that goes against His nature, or His Word.  He is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.  Praise the Lord!

P.S.- As for the question, &#8220;Can God make a rock too heavy for Himself to lift?&#8221;  The answer is no.  Why?  Consider this, if God were to make a rock as big as He could then it would by definition be taking up all available space.  It would be the only thing around, there would be no room left for anything but the rock.  So, the rock would be weightless because we all know that weight is only the result of one body pulling on another; there would be nothing pulling on the rock so it would be weightless.  Therefore, God could easily lift it.  You could too, if there was room for ya&#8230;and something to stand on&#8230;and air&#8230;and&#8230; ;)

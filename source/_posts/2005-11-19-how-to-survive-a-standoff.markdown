I posted this list before on<a href="http://openswitch.blogspot.com"> my old blog</a> but in light of <a href="http://www.dedelen.com/2005/11/that-other-standoff.html">some recent observations</a> by a man I respect, Dan Edelen, I want to repost this list.  I see more flaming among Christians than among anyone else.  I can understand why, really I can.  But I hope that people recognize the limitations of the internet.  While it is a great way to share ideas and even challenge ideas, it&#8217;s not the best place to get someone to change their core beliefs.  The internet (read: blogs) almost inherently limits itself to surface discussions.  Nothing can ever take the place of face-to-face relationships.  That said, here are some practical guidelines to keep in mind before entering into debate with others via the WWW.

## Don't get personal

If you start out insulting your opponent, your point is dead in the water before you make it. if you make the argument personal, the other person can't accept your point without accepting personal defeat.

## Don't get personal

Even if your opponent insults you, don't take the bait. if you're that offended, walk away. no good can come of it. if you still want to make your point, just ignore the insult. keep debating like it never happened.

## Don't take it personal

No matter how much your opponent attacks your argument, your examples (even if they're personal), or your world view, it isn't personal. don't take it as such.

## Pick your battles

Don't go into a fight if it requires the other person to change their view of the world. that doesn't mean democrats shouldn't debate republicans, or Christians shouldn't debate atheists. that just means that you should only go into a fight if you think your opponent can change his mind about the issue at hand, without it displacing or weakening his/her world view.

## Concede

The only way the debate will keep moving is if you and your opponent make progress. this requires you to acknowledge when your opponent is right. or even to acknowledge when your point would require a violation of 'pick your battles'. this doesn't mean you agree with your opponent. this doesn't mean you lost. this just means that your argument is bested by your opponent, and you don't have one to supersede it.

## You can't pick your friends

Everyone has different reasons for what they believe. when you make a point, anyone in the debate might take your side on that point. you can't pick your enemies either. so be as nice as possible to everyone, because you never know when they'll agree with you on something you didn't expect them to.

## Remember what you're (not) fighting for

Don't assume that your way of looking at things is infallible. always bear in mind what your non-negotiables are. don't fight your non-negotiables, because no progress can be made there. if you get into a debate, assume that you might be proven wrong, so make sure it's a debate that's not hard-wired to your world view.

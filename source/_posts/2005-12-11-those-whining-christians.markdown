Perhaps one reason the world at large pays so little credence to Christians is because instead of proclaiming the wonders and love of God we are whining about how the secular world doesn&#8217;t cater to our every whim.  &#8220;Call it a <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CHRIST</span></span></span>mas tree or else I won&#8217;t shop at your store anymore!&#8221;  &#8220;Make better Christian movies or I&#8217;ll stop seeing the ones you&#8217;re making now!&#8221;  &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t Christian music getting more secular attention?&#8221;  &#8220;Why does the ACLU hate Christians?&#8221;  You know, for all the whining we do as Christians, we rarely use our limited time on earth to proclaim the love of Christ as much as we could.

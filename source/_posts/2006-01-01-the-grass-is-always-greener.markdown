So I&#8217;m jumping the fence to Wordpress 2.0.  I just can&#8217;t stand it any more.  Come what may, here I go.  Over the next few days there may be some glitches or weirdness going on here at Open Switch as I wrestle with this thing.  If you come here one day and see nothing here, start praying immediately.

Here&#8217;s my checklist:

Upgrade to Wordpress 2.0: <font color="green">Completed</font>

Upgrade to K2 Release 153: <font color="green">Completed</font>

Reinstall plugins: <font color="green">Completed</font>

Fix for IE: <font color="green">Completed</font>

1/2/05  9:00AM: Still working on some of the styling aspects.  It&#8217;ll take a little while, unfortunately.  But my content is still intact and that alone makes me jump for joy.

1/2/05 9:28AM: Updated the Extended Live Archives so they display properly in IE.  Nice. The last thing I need to fix for IE is the comments.

1/2/05 12:13PM: Completed fixing for IE.  Simple solution for the comment problem is listed <a target="_blank" title="binary bonsai" href="http://flickr.com/groups/binarybonsai/discuss/131653/?search=css+comment">here</a>. On with the blogging!  Woo Hoo!  Oh, have to find new contact form plugin, but that&#8217;s not a biggie.  I have a couple in mind.

1/2/05 2:13PM: Completely done now.  The new plugin for the contact form is <a title="contact form plugin source" href="http://ryanduff.net/projects/wp-contactform/">found here</a>.

1/2/05 7:00PM: I thought I was done but the K2 revision 153 turned out to be buggy so I had to upgrade to the <a title="get the latest release of K2" href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/01/02/k2-beta-two-r156/">latest release r156</a>.

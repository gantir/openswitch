When I get into a conversation about privacy in relation to government surveilance, profiling and information gathering I'm most often up against an individual who holds the position of "I've got nothing to hide," and "Only if you're doing something wrong should you worry, and then you don't deserve to keep it private."  Security expert [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/) calls this argument the "most common retort against privacy advocates."  Unfortunately the anti-privacy stance usually stems from an inaccurate definition of privacy, as well as an uninformed concept of the dangers a lack of privacy can lead to.

Everyone values privacy to some extent.  If you say you literally have "nothing to hide" I'd ask if you're willing to let me photograph you naked.  Then I'd ask if you're OK with giving up your rights to that photo and letting me show it to your neighbors and co-workers.  Of course, few people would consent to being photographed naked, much less allow that photo to be viewed by others publicly.  So we see that some level of privacy is important to everyone, now we're just arguing about the level of that privacy.

Maybe a line could be drawn.  Maybe one would argue that there's a difference between physical privacy and information privacy.  If that's the case then I'd comment that I'd really like to view your credit card statements from last year as well as your medical records.  Those things, after all, are merely data.  They don't result in physical violation or harm.  There are no "dead bodies" if someone possesses knowledge of your grocery shopping habits (which, by the way, are being tracked when you use your shopping discount card at your local mart), so what real harm is caused?

The harm becomes evident when entities (government or otherwise) begin aggregating this data.  For example, perhaps you recently purchased a wig.  That data isn't significant in any way.  But couple that data with the fact that you also recently purchased a book about cancer.  Now, with those two pieces of information, it's pretty easy to infer that you're a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.  That's information which you may or may not want others to know, at the very least you'd want a say in who you tell.  Notice at no point did I peruse your confidential medical records to "invade your privacy."

Often it's the secondary uses of the data that have the potential to cause the most harm to an individual.  I call this the "Nazi argument."  Laws change, governments change.  Things that are legal now may be illegal in the future.  How long is your data being kept by these agencies?  To what purpose could that data be potentially used in the future?
I imagine Nazi Germany in World War 2.  What if data collection as it exists today was available and in use five years before Hitler came into power.  What if the shopping habits, reading habits and communications had all been recorded and stored by the government?  Don't you think Hitler would have been terribly interested in that data as he attempted to slaughter an entire group of people?  I believe he would have placed an extremely high value on that data.

I'm _not_ saying that the United States is going to build gas chambers or attempt genocide.  What I _am_ saying is that when data is collected, especially in digital format, it becomes a liability to the citizen from whom that data was collected.  It's a digital shadow, and for each of us, that shadow is growing more and more valuable to third parties.  Do you really believe that Facebook is free because Mark Zuckerberg is just a good guy?  No, it's free because Facebook gathers your information, tracks your internet usage and then sells that information to advertisers.  You're not the consumer, you're the product.

If we're not proactive, our privacy and freedom will gradually be given away for the sake of expediency and a false sense of security.  Some may say they've got nothing to hide, but they still place curtains over their windows.

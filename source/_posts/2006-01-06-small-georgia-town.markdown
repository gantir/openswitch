I drive by this store all the time and every time I do I chuckle to myself.  I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago; I didn&#8217;t ride a horse until I was 18 and even then I didn&#8217;t find it pleasurable.  What&#8217;s more, until I started working in Griffin I didn&#8217;t even know there was such a thing as a &#8220;saddlery.&#8221;  I guess I just assumed that when you bought a horse it came with a saddle as standard equipment (like cars come with airbags.)  I love seeing this store, though.  To me it represents quaint Southern culture.  A culture that is so different from the one I grew up in.  I don&#8217;t dare go inside though.  It has &#8220;Yankees shot on sight&#8221; written all over it.

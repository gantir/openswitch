One of the blessings &#38; curses of being a Gen-Xer is having a basic knowledge of computers.  We&#8217;re born knowing how these machines work.  But at my church you&#8217;d think I was the Dalai Lama of computers judging by the amount of requests I get to &#8220;fix&#8221; someone&#8217;s computer.

One recent conversation went like this:

> &#8220;Hey, Ben, you&#8217;re good with computers, right?  Can you set our office computers (4 of them) so they can talk to each other?&#8221;

> &#8220;You mean a LAN?&#8221;

> &#8220;Um&#8230;.yeah, whatever it is, can you do it?&#8221;

> &#8220;Sure thing.&#8221;

Another conversation several weeks ago:

> &#8220;Hey, Ben, you&#8217;re good with computers right?  I opened up my internet [browser] and it&#8217;s just a small box.  I think I broke it.&#8221;

> &#8220;No, just click this box here.&#8221; I click the maximize button and the screen magically maximizes.  Oooooo&#8217;s and Ahhhhhh&#8217;s commence.

Honestly, I like the attention.  I&#8217;m being recognized for something I&#8217;m good at.  Never mind the fact that I&#8217;m good at being a youth pastor too, I know COMPUTERS!

Today a lovely older lady in the church came to me.  She wanted to buy a laptop computer and had some questions.  Her first sentence was, &#8220;Hey, Ben, you&#8217;re good with computers right?&#8221;  As a side note I&#8217;d like to point out that how people know I&#8217;m good with computers is beyond me.  I don&#8217;t go around advertising it.  But people obviously must be talking with each other about the new youth pastor who&#8217;s good with computers.  The funny part is I&#8217;m not that good, I&#8217;m average.  Compared to the <em>real </em><acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> guys I&#8217;m a doofus.  I digress.

Back to the lovely lady who&#8217;s in the market for a laptop.  Evidently someone had told her that all she needed was to install a wireless card in her computer and she&#8217;d have internet access for free by getting it from a satellite.  I realized that I had to start with the basics and explain how people connect to the internet.  Then I explained what a wireless internet cloud was.  I drew diagrams and everything.  She caught on really quick too.  It feels good being able to help someone understand something better.

All this to say that it&#8217;s funny to me how I was hired to be a minister to students but have also taken on the role of the unofficial office <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> man.  I&#8217;m not complaining, though it would be nice to get the same recognition for my madd exegetical skillz.

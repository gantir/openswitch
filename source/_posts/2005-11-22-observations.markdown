1.  Javascript is extremely hard to style because it has a nasty tendancy to display differently in IE and FireFox when you do try to tweak it.

2.  Designing a blog is like trying to read the minds of those who will visit it.

3.  Thanksgiving is the day after tomorrow.

4.  Word Press themes are far superior and numerous than Movable Type themes.

5.  Beards are itchy.

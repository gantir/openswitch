It&#8217;s fascinating how different barbecue is down here in the South when compared to the North where I grew up.  In the North when someone says the word &#8220;barbecue&#8221; most people think of food that is cooked over a grill.  Usually it&#8217;s going to be hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken  or ribs that they&#8217;ll think about too.  These meats could be served with or without actual barbecue sauce.  The cook will usually ask you if you want sauce and then will put the sauce on the meat as it&#8217;s cooking on the grill.  The point is that barbecue in the North is mainly defined by the use of a grill.  For instance, if someone says, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you come over to my house for a barbecue?&#8221;  Most people will get mental pictures of a grill on the back porch.

Not so down here in the South. Unlike Northern barbecue the meat is sometimes cooked over a grill but by no means has to be.  People don&#8217;t automatically imagine a grill when the word &#8220;barbecue&#8221; is mentioned.  The focus is not on the means of the cooking, but on the substance of the cooking.   When someone says &#8220;barbecue&#8221; down here most people think of pulled beef, chicken or pork served either on its own or on bread, making a sandwich.  The sauce is <em>never</em> served premixed with this meat.  It is always added on in the desired amount by the person eating it.  The sauce is fundamentally different from what I&#8217;ve seen in the North too.  Northern barbecue sauce is usually pretty thick, about the consistency of thick ketchup.  In the South, however, barbecue sauce is usually (though not always) about the consistency of Italian salad dressing.  It tends to be much spicier too.

I&#8217;m not sure which barbecue I like better.  I grew up with Northern barbecue so it has a lot of sentimental value for me.  But the longer I live in the South, the more I realize that Southern barbecue is superior to Northern.  Take note Northern barbecue masters, there&#8217;s something you might be able to learn from the South here.  But regardless of how you <span class="caps">B-B-Q</span> one thing will forever remain constant: men will always have a fascination with burning meat outdoors.

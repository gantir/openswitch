It&#8217;s Christmas eve, good night world.  Santa, I swear I&#8217;ve been good this year&#8230;mostly.  Please don&#8217;t overlook my house tonight!  Thomas, sleep well.  Tomorrow you&#8217;ll get to open even <em>more</em> presents!  My wife, I love you with everything I have.  Have a merry Christmas eve.  Gentle reader, may you sleep well tonight also.  I hope you dream of sugar plums, peace on earth and good will towards all men.  Waking to the smell of love and warmth with your families.

Jesus, thank you for loving me to the fullest extent possible.  For giving it all and never faltering.  This Christmas my prayer is that I will be a sanctuary where your Spirit dwells and from which your light may shine for all the world to see.

Merry Christmas.

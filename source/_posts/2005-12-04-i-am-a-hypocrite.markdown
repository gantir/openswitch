I am a hypocrite.  Are you looking for a two-faced man?  Well, here I am.  &#8220;Do as I say, not as I do&#8221; has been implied either directly or indirectly by me on more than one occasion.  Not everyone thinks I&#8217;m a hypocrite, though some may.  Generally speaking, I do a good job of hiding my inadequacies from the population of earth.  The fact that I am not perfect may come as a complete and utter shock to a few of you so to aid in your enlightenment regarding my faults let me give you a few examples of my hypocrisy:

- I tell people to share their faith because it&#8217;s what the Bible tells us to do but when it comes down to me personally I have a real hard time doing it (and rarely do.)
- I think change needs to be made in many churches in America but I don&#8217;t want to put my own head on the chopping block to make it happen.
- I want my son to grow up having a love for books but I haven&#8217;t read one through in months.
- I think it is essential for Christians to do daily devotions but I have <em>never </em>regularly done them myself.
- I believe that Christians shouldn&#8217;t cuss or call people names but when someone cuts me off or is rude to me in traffic I think terrible things about them.
- I think overseas missions are great and honorable but I never, ever want to go myself.
- I think materialism is very detrimental to my walk with Christ but I want a new car so bad I can smell it.

I&#8217;m not writing this because I feel the need to &#8220;confess&#8221; to you or air my dirty laundry.  I am writing this to encourage us all to be honest and transparent with ourselves regarding our shortcomings.  If there&#8217;s one thing each of us has in common it&#8217;s that we all have been a hypocrite at one time or another.  We have all at some point told another to &#8220;do as I say, not as I do.&#8221;  I believe we all need to be honest and transparent with each other.  Not only is it healthy for our relationships with others but it is healthy for relationship with ourselves.  Furthermore, as a Christian I know that we all need to be honest and transparent with God.  Yet how can we do this if we can&#8217;t even be honest and transparent with ourselves?  Let&#8217;s all be aware of (yet not focus on) our imperfections as humans.  While it may be wrong and harmful to be always focusing on our faults, it is just as bad to attempt to deny them altogether.

As I was reading over this post I got a little scared.  &#8220;What if they read this and see right through me?&#8221;  I thought.  &#8220;What if they don&#8217;t come back?&#8221;  Then I realized that while some of you reading this may get turned off from my transparency, I&#8217;ll bet that for most of you just the opposite will be true.

I haven&#8217;t lived in the South my whole life.  I was born and raised near Chicago, Illinois and loved every minute of my Northern upbringing.  Real hot dogs, pop, barbecue that didn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.openswitch.org/blog/how-do-you-bbq/">necessarily include barbecue sauce</a>.  It was great.  Now, since moving to the South, I&#8217;ve discovered several things I love about it too.  Here&#8217;s a small sample:

1. My wife.  Hey, if I never came down here I wouldn&#8217;t have met my best friend.  Love ya, sweetie!

2. The biscuits.  I never had real home-made biscuits from scratch until I lived in the South.  Fattening?  Oh yeah.  Tasty?  Pardon me as I drool at the mere thought of them.

3. The weather.  We&#8217;re well into December and the high for today is a balmy 54<sup>o</sup>.  It&#8217;s sunny too.

But one thing they didn&#8217;t tell me before I moved down here was that there&#8217;s some weird and annoying crap that goes on &#8216;round these parts.  A few examples:

1. Southern hospitality is a reality.  But it should be called Southern-need-to-know-it-all-ism.  <em>Everyone </em>wants to know <em>everything </em>about your life at <em>all </em>times.  Don&#8217;t plan on going to the grocery store unless you&#8217;re up for the cashier putting you through a reenactment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>.

2. Everyone, including me, is a horrible driver.  You have to experience Atlanta traffic first-hand to know what I&#8217;m talking about.  And if it snows you&#8217;d better just stay at home.  It doesn&#8217;t matter how adept you are at driving in slick conditions, the fact is you&#8217;ll be the only one on the road that can.  The only thing more frightening than spinning out of control is watching someone else spin out of control right towards you and knowing there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.

3. You see the weirdest crap in the middle of the road down here.  For example, while dodging the dead armadillos and cats on the road this morning as I was driving to work, I was listening the traffic report.  &#8220;Lots of congestion on I85 North due to a ladder in the road.&#8221;  The reporter said.  <em>A ladder?!</em>  Well, I suppose I can imagine a situation where a <strike>redneck</strike> person would need to bring a ladder to his buddy&#8217;s house to help him put up a deer stand.  Forgetting to secure it in the back of his pickup truck before he left, though, he watches in horror as it flies off the back of his truck while speeding down the interstate.  I can see something like that happening once in a while, but I hear of traffic congestion due <em>specifically </em>to a ladder in the road at least once every two weeks.  Are there really that many people who need to haul ladders around?  What&#8217;s more, do that many people not know how to secure one to their vehicles?  Look, just buy a freakin&#8217; ladder and keep it in your garage like a normal person.  That way you won&#8217;t have to ask Bubba to bring his when he comes over to help you put your deer stand up in your backyard.  Don&#8217;t have the room to store a ladder?  Get a <a href="http://www.littlegiantladder.com/">Little Giant</a>.  <a href="http://tvplex.go.com/touchstone/homeimprovement/bios/karn.html">Al Borland</a> endorses them so they&#8217;ve gotta be quality.

Still, in spite of the weird stuff I see down here, I have truly fallen in love with the South.  Even though I&#8217;ll forever bear the stigma of &#8220;Yankee.&#8221;

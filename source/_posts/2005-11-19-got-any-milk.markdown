We got crank-called last night.  Some punk kid called at 1AM asking if we &#8220;got any milk?&#8221;  My wife said, &#8220;you have the wrong number&#8221; to which the pimple-popping-kid replied, &#8220;no, my dad told me to call this number if I ever needed any milk.&#8221;  She promptly hung up.

You know, if you&#8217;re gonna go through the trouble of crank calling a house at 1AM, at least have something funny to say.  Luckily it didn&#8217;t wake Thomas up.  If he had then I probably wouldn&#8217;t be laughing about this call, I&#8217;d be fuming.  This is the effect that TV and video games are having on the youth of America.  They no longer possess the capacity to make good crank calls anymore.  Instead of creativity all they can come up with is &#8220;got any milk?&#8221;

I&#8217;ve been saying this for months now, ever since I found out about <a title="Link to MySpace.com" href="http://myspace.com/">MySpace.com</a>.  Finally MSNBC has <a title="Link to MSNBC report" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11064451/">put out a piece</a> that deals with the inherent dangers teens face when they share personal information on their MySpace pages.  This article was posted by MSNBC on Jan. 27th, 2006 and as of that date they report that,

> In the last month, authorities have charged at least three men with sexually assaulting teenagers they found through MySpace.com and just this week police found a missing 15-year-old girl who investigators say was sexually assaulted by a 26-year-old man she met through the site.

The problem is that the vast majority of parents are basically worthless when it comes to keeping up on their children&#8217;s internet activities.  I&#8217;m the minister to a youth group comprised primarily of girls so information like the above quote scares me to death.  I don&#8217;t know what we as responsible adults can do about this danger besides educate the kids and their parents.  Personally, I feel like my hands are tied.  Realistically all I can do is spread the word to use extreme caution when sharing info online.

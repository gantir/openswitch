Just one more reason everyone should be using FireFox: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/internet_explor.html">Internet Explorer sucks.</a>  You can&#8217;t ignore the facts:

MSIE is 98% unsafe. There were only 7 days in 2004 without an unpatched publicly disclosed security hole. (This is very bad.)

Firefox is 15% unsafe. There were 56 days with an unpatched publicly disclosed security hole. 30 of those days were a Mac hole that only affected Mac users. Windows Firefox was 7% unsafe. (This is very good.)

Over Christmas vacation I converted my mom from IE to FireFox.  She was amazed at how fast it loaded web pages.  But that&#8217;s only one reason to switch over.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Give it a try, it&#8217;s free</a>.

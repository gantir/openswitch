That&#8217;s the name of the injury Thomas had (<a href="http://www.fpnotebook.com/ORT45.htm">Here&#8217;s a link that describes it using big doctor words.</a>)

Yesterday I wrote about how Thomas had pulled his arm away from my wife in a fit of toddler rebellion and this had evidently injured his elbow.  We then went to the pediatrician and they tried to &#8220;reduce&#8221; it (that&#8217;s a big doctor word that means they tried to fix his arm.)   We thought they had succeeded but after spending most of last night awake with him and after noticing that he still wasn&#8217;t using his arm this morning we called the doctor back and he said he&#8217;d like to see Thomas again.  We went back in this afternoon and the doctor tried to &#8220;reduce&#8221; his injury again and it worked!  He was acting like nothing was wrong only 5 minutes after the doctor fixed his arm.  Needless to say, we&#8217;re extremely relieved.

Through all of this I&#8217;ve learned that it helps make Thomas calm when I&#8217;m calm.  When I start freaking out Thomas does too.  I also learned that it&#8217;s useless to try to teach a toddler where his elbow is when he pronounces &#8220;Elmo&#8221; the same way as &#8220;elbow.&#8221;  So, I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Where&#8217;s your elbow?&#8221; and he would point to Elmo.  He still doesn&#8217;t know where his elbow is, but he knows that we had to reduce Elmo so he could use his arm again.

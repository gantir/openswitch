I experienced some of the weirdest crap when I was in Boy Scouts.  In America I think Scouts get a bad rap.  They are generally seen as goody-two-shoes that administer first aid to kids who fall off their bikes and help old ladies cross dangerous intersections.  Being a former Scout myself, I can say I never did anything of the sort.  Instead, my memories of Scouting are filled with bizarre and often dangerous situations.  Now, don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, I loved Scouting.  Some of my best memories are from the Boy Scouts.  Nevertheless, let me recount a few of the more bizarre ones for you (by the way, all this goes to show <a href="http://www.openswitch.org/2005/11/high_school_students_use_myspa.html">that kids do stupid stuff</a>):

I remember jumping off a 50 foot cliff into a river, making sure to jump out and away from the cliff because a fall straight down (as opposed to out and down) would result in a quick and probably very painful death on the jagged rocks below.  Thank God I didn&#8217;t slip.

I remember getting utterly lost in Missouri on the Ozark Trail with my troop.  We were lost for almost a whole day, which is pretty scary when you&#8217;re 16.  It&#8217;s amazing how well the teenage mind can conjure up thoughts of what it would feel like to get mauled by a bear.

I remember the time I was a counselor at a Boy Scout summer camp, sitting in another counselor&#8217;s cabin watching him and his buddy get high on some Marijuana they found growing wild in the septic field.  Evidently they dried it out first (no, I didn&#8217;t smoke any.)

I remember that same summer learning how to play &#8220;the axe game.&#8221;  It&#8217;s basically like playing chicken but with a newly sharpened axe.  Go ahead, use your imagination.  Thank God both my feet are still attached to my legs.

I remember backpacking in the Rockies at <a href="http://www.philmont.com">Philmont</a>.  It must have been about 2AM, I was wearing my sleeping shorts, no shirt or socks and my boots were loose and untied.  I was extremely bleary-eyed, couldn&#8217;t see straight.  As I was &#8220;using it&#8221; I heard some grunting, some <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">REALLY</span></span></span></span> loud sniffing and a soft growl.  Yep, it was a bear.  It probably was a bear.  It might have been a bear.  OK, OK, I didn&#8217;t actually <em>see</em> a bear (or anything but the tree I was peeing on), but I was so scared that I didn&#8217;t have time to finish, I just turned around and ran back to my tent.  Diving in head first I finally pulled my shorts up and commenced prayer.  I never did see a bear while at Philmont.

I remember one of our assistant Scout Masters shedding all clothing except for his tighty whities and jumping into a lake from the roof of a boat house.  Weird memory.

I remember the time I was told that mac and cheese tasted great when mixed with dehydrated carrot bits, cayenne pepper, black pepper, extra salt, and some other spices I can&#8217;t remember.  No, it didn&#8217;t taste too good.  That remains the only time I almost puked from the mere taste and texture of something.

But for all the weird and bizarre memories I have of Scouts, there are those moments that were life changing.  I remember at Philmont, one night 3AM going out of my tent to sit on rock the size of a VW Bug in the middle of a field.  The moon shining brightly, the air so crisp it gave me goose bumps; I could see my breath.  It was that night that I weeped, earnestly seeking the Lord and realized for the first time that I was being called into full time ministry.  I may have a fun time recounting the odd stuff about the Scouts, but the fact of the matter is I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today without it.

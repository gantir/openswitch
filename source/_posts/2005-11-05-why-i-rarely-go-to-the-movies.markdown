I rarely go to the movies anymore.  Mostly it&#8217;s because the cost for my wife and I to attend a movie is about $20 not including drinks.  If we throw drinks and candy into the mix we&#8217;re looking at close to $40.  $40!?  For what?  Why should I have to pay <em>that </em>much money to watch a movie in front of a snoring man who is beside a screaming baby (in a rated R movie nonetheless) and just 3 rows up from a group of teenagers IMing each other on their cell phones having no respect for the fact that <em>some </em> people are there to watch the movie instead of socializing?  Those cinemas must have a lot of overhead.

I guess some people like that social environment, I can do without it.  The only reason I&#8217;d go to a movie is to see a movie as soon as it comes out so I can talk about it with friends.  The environment in which I see the movie is something I put up with as opposed to something I enjoy.

Me, I would rather wait until the movie comes out on <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">DVD</span></span></span></span>.  That way I can see it for about 1/4 the price of what it would cost in the theater, cuddle with my wife instead of being separated by an arm rest, and eat or drink whatever I want without being nervous that I&#8217;ll be discovered for bringing &#8220;outside food or drinks&#8221; into the theater.

The way I see it,  there are a few good reasons to see movies in the theater such as the size of the screen, the sound quality and the fact that you&#8217;ll see it as soon as it&#8217;s released.  But the reasons against seeing a movie in the theater far outweigh the reasons for. Kids these days.

And I&#8217;m not even getting into much of what&#8217;s talked about <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20051104/1927247_F.shtml">recently on Tech Dirt</a>.

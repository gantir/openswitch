There are two parts to this post.  The first part is what is presented in Luke 16.  The second part is my personal thoughts that were sparked by the first part.  Part one and Part two are unrelated except for the fact that the words &#8220;poor&#8221;, &#8220;rich&#8221; and &#8220;God&#8221; are found in both.  I&#8217;m not arguing that my personal thoughts as expressed in Part two are based on the Scripture in Part one.  They&#8217;re not.

## Part One:

In Luke 16:19-31 we see the story of a rich man and a poor man.  The rich man is not named, just a generic rich man I guess.  The poor man&#8217;s name is Lazarus.  Well, they both die and the rich man goes to Hell and the poor man goes to Heaven or to Abraham&#8217;s side.  Those are two slightly different concepts but for my purposes here we&#8217;ll just say they&#8217;re the same thing.  Well, one of the points that Luke&#8217;s making here is that the way a person looks on the outside doesn&#8217;t necessarily reflect where their eternal destiny will be.  To say it another way, a person who is in good standing with God is not necessarily going to be materially blessed and a person that is in poor standing with God is not necessarily going to be materially impoverished.

There was a theology that was very prevalent at this time.  Nowadays we call it &#8220;common theology.&#8221; One aspect of  it assumed that if a person was in good standing with God then He would materially bless them (such as the Pharisees.)  It conversely assumed that if a person wasn&#8217;t materially blessed then it must be due to something they did to make God mad.  Needless to say, this was very off-base and Scripturally unfounded, hence the title we give it today, &#8220;common theology&#8221; (as opposed to biblical theology.)

## Part Two:

Learning about the idea of common theology got me thinking about something that I see a lot of these days: the poor.  I started thinking about the poor not only in our country but around the world.  I&#8217;ve heard a lot people, mainly (but not always) conservatives make statements like, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re poor because they don&#8217;t want to work.&#8221; Then they will use that excuse to warrant getting rid of Welfare, Unemployment and the like.  But isn&#8217;t this much like the fallacy we see in common theology as explained in Part One?  Sure, most people won&#8217;t say that a person&#8217;s poverty is due to and act of God, but they&#8217;ll blame it on something that I think is equally vague, &#8220;not having a desire to work.&#8221;

While I will agree that there are definitely some poor in the U.S. and abroad that are poor due to their own devices (i.e. not having the desire to work, drug addiction, etc.)  It&#8217;s just flat out wrong to assume that if a person is poor they are in that situation because of their own actions.  It is equally wrong to assume a person is rich because of their own hard work.  There are a myriad of factors that play into being poor and being rich.  One of the most obvious factors being the family you&#8217;re born into.

Don&#8217;t hear me say that I don&#8217;t think rich people work for their money, I&#8217;m not saying that.  I&#8217;m just saying that a person&#8217;s financial situation usually has more to do with uncontrollable factors and less to do with the desire (or the lack thereof) to work.  You simply cannot look at where a person is and assume you know how they got there.

Keep in mind too, that each of you reading this post has to admit that you have to some degree benefited from the work of someone else.  None of us is where we are today, financially speaking, due <em>solely</em> to our own hard work.  So before we jump onto the bandwagon and start blaming laziness for the poor&#8217;s situation let&#8217;s take an honest look at why we are in our current situation and acknowledge the fact that it&#8217;s not <em>solely</em> due to our own efforts.

With that in mind, let&#8217;s not push the poor aside.  Let&#8217;s not give up on them.  Let&#8217;s continue to offer programs for getting them back on their feet.  Let&#8217;s not let a few lazies condemn the rest of the poor to life-long poverty.

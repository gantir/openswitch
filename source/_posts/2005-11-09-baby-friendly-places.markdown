I agree with what <a title="The non-baby friendly coffee shop rears its ugly head - Blogging Baby - www.bloggingbaby.com _" href="http://www.bloggingbaby.com/entry/1234000733067264/">Sarah Gilbert writes here</a>.  She basically points out that parents often have a hard time finding restuarants or in this case, coffee houses that are child friendly.  I can completely relate with her frustrations when she says: <blockquote>&#8220;I can attest: parenting is not easy, it?s isolating, those of us who stay home with our kids have few outlets.&#8221;</blockquote>  Even though I&#8217;m not a stay at home dad I can relate with the isolation factor.  It&#8217;s not as easy anymore to go to a restuarant or go anywhere for that matter.  It&#8217;s always a fairly large production.  So, when I find a restuarant like <a href="http://www.achimskbob.com/">Achim&#8217;s</a>, where the <em>owner</em> comes out to our table and playfully interacts with our son I make sure to recommend the restuarant to all my friends and frequently return.  As a parent, finding a child friendly restuarant, pediatrician or store is like finding a diamond.

On a side note, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if all child friendly businesses put up a badge or something like what is pictured above?

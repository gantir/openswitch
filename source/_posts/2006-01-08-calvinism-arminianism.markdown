Free will or predistination?? In the end it doesn&#8217;t really matter.? Here&#8217;s why:

A strict Calvinist would believe that if a person accepted Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior, etc. and lived a righteous life then, on their death bed renounced their faith, they <em>were never</em> saved to begin with (due to Perseverance of the saints) so they go straight to Hell.

A strict Arminian would believe that if a person accepted Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior, etc. and lived a righteous life then, on their death bed renounced their faith, they? <em>were </em>saved but aren&#8217;t anymore so they go straight to Hell.

Now, maybe this is a gross oversimplification of the issues at hand but you&#8217;ve got to admit, it&#8217;s a pretty complelling argument that pragmatically speaking it doesn&#8217;t really matter if you&#8217;re a Calvinist or Arminian.? What matters is if you have faith in Christ.

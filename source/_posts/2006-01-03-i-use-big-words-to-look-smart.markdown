Now that my blog appears to be working I can finally start writing again.  So, I was sitting in church this past Sunday, listening to the pastor present his newest and freshest sermon.  He was preaching (very well, I might add) on Revelation.  While it was a very good and challenging sermon I must admit that I got distracted and started thinking about how we ministers and &#8220;Bible educated&#8221; folk sometimes throw around large theological terms when we talk about God or the Bible.  I&#8217;m not sure this is always necessary.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, these complex theological terms are necessary for certain things like academic writing or discussing complex ideas with others who know the terms.  They&#8217;re necessary in these and other situations because they concisely describe multifaceted concepts that would take too much effort to explain otherwise.  Basically, they&#8217;re theological shorthand.

However, I know that sometimes I like to throw these terms around in everyday conversation just to make myself seem smarter.  Am I the only one who does this?  I think not.  I&#8217;ll bet there are more professionals out there who use big words to seem smarter than I could shake a stick at.  Getting them to admit it is a different story.  At any rate, here&#8217;s a list of my favorite theological terms to toss around when I want to look smart:

Diaspora: The dispersion of the Christians after the stoning of Stephen.

Extra-biblical writings: Historical writings that were written about the same time as the Bible but are not considered Canon.

Canon: The books of the Bible that are considered to be divinely inspired.

Hyperbole: An or overstatement not to be taken literally but used to express another meaning. (i.e. Luke 14:26: &#8220; If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. &#8220;)

Anthropomorphism: Attributing human characteristics to something not human. (i.e. The body of Christ.)

Modalism: The view that the three members of the Trinity are different modes of God&#8217;s activity rather than separate Persons.

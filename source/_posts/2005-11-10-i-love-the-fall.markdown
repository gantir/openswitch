It&#8217;s one of those completely gorgeous days today.  The kind of day where I just want to go out into the yard and rake up a big pile of leaves just so I can play in it.  Actually, that&#8217;s exactly what I did.  I introduced Thomas to the concept of playing in a pile of leaves.  I tried to show him how to jump in and then throw the leaves up into the air.  I got in the middle of the pile first as he watched.  Then I put him in the middle and he cried.  Too much too fast I gues.  He would rather stay on the outter ring of the leaf pile and throw one or two leaves around.  That&#8217;s OK, I have the feeling that it won&#8217;t be long before I can&#8217;t keep him out of the pile.

I've recently discovered the reality of what exactly [ballet does to a dancer's feet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/sep/05/dance).  It's been quite the eye-opener.  Somewhere in the back of my mind I always knew that any kind of extreme physical exercise would have serious consequences.  I knew that runners work through joint problems, weight lifters suffer the same.  But when I saw the pictures of various dancer's feet, I was shocked that anyone would put themselves through that kind of punishment to achieve any goal.

Then I thought about myself and my passion. My commitment to computers and software are taking their toll on my body too.  I'm in a constant battle with my waistline, my lower back ain't doing so hot with all the sitting I do and carpal tunnel syndrome is a very real hazard.  Yet in spite of the work-related dangers - which may or may not be as serious as those in other professions - nothing could convince me to reconsider my career choice.  I'll work around the risks, and take extra steps to live with them.

So should it be quite so shocking that a ballerina suffers through chronic joint pain and foot deformation to pursue her passion?  No.

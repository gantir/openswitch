I&#8217;ve told my youth group this so I have no problem telling you, I&#8217;ll do almost anything for the right price.  I say &#8220;almost&#8221; because I won&#8217;t do anything immoral or illegal for any amount of money.  Examples of things I consider immoral would be self-mutilation, putting myself or others in harm&#8217;s way, etc.  Otherwise, there&#8217;s nothing I won&#8217;t do for a certain amount of money.  The amount of money, of course, varies based on the thing you want me to do.  You want to see me eat brussel sprouts?  $5.  Eat a hissing cockroach alive?  $100.  You get the idea.  It&#8217;s with this concept in mind that I will pose some questions to you, readers.

1) If you were given a choice that upon the flip of a coin you would either get $100,000,000 cash (if it&#8217;s tails) or die (if it&#8217;s heads) would you do it?  Would you take the chance?

2) If you were to be given $100,000,000 in exchange for you leaving the country ALONE and could never return nor contact any family or friends in the U.S. again, would you take the money?

3) If someone offered you $100,000,000 in exchange for sensitive government information (pertaining to the country in which you reside, and assuming you knew something extremely sensitive like codes to nuclear missile silos) would you take the money and become a traitor?

I&#8217;m sitting here at my desk, thankful that I don&#8217;t have a job where I have to walk around a lot.  I can mercifully sit at my desk pretty much all day today except for when I have to go to the restroom.  Why am I thankful for sitting, you ask?  Well, as I walked into my office today I saw on the floor a Veggie Tales video cassette my son had pulled from the shelf yesterday.  As I bent over to pick it up I heard it.  That dreaded sound of fabric tearing across my dairy aire.  Yes, my pants ripped.  To my credit they are old pants that have (had?) a worn-out spot back there.  They&#8217;re khakis too so they&#8217;re not exactly super-tough.  Boy, nothing like ripping your pants while bending over to make ya feel fat.  On the up-side though, this means I get to go buy some new khakis.  w00t!

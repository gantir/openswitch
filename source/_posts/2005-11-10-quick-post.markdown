In the background (actually, right behind me) is playing the Veggie Tales video Thomas is currently addicted to.  He&#8217;s not really watching it though, he&#8217;s engrosed in the book &#8220;The Very Hungry Caterpillar.&#8221;  He&#8217;s just sitting there making noises that to him probably sound like speech.  He&#8217;s such an avid reader!  Uh oh, he heard me typing, I think he wants to tell y&#8217;all something

There are at least three aspects that a blogger needs to consider when creating and writing for his blog: design, content and functionality.  We&#8217;ve read all about how a blog <a title="Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html">needs to be functional</a> and how we shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;<a title="busblog" href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2004/06/how-to-blog-by-tony-pierce-110-1.htm">worry very much about the design of [our] blog. Image is a fakeout.</a>&#8220; Those things are very true.  After all, who wants to read a blog that&#8217;s using a font/background that makes your eyes hurt? (That was a jab at all those teens who have ugly <a title="Myspace" href="http://www.myspace.com">Myspace accounts</a>.)  And if I can&#8217;t figure out where I am or how to get around I&#8217;ll probably not come back to a site as often.  Also, we must always keep in mind that it&#8217;s the content that keeps readers coming back for more.  They&#8217;re not gonna come back to sit and look at your awesome header graphic you made in Photoshop (I speak to myself here as much as anyone.)

Still, according to new research the design of a blog or web site is actually vital to the site&#8217;s success.  It&#8217;s been shown that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">potential readers can make snap decisions in just 50 milliseconds</a> upon first seeing a site.  That means that no matter how substantial your content is or how easily someone can navigate and use your site, if it&#8217;s not aesthetically pleasing chances are you&#8217;re not developing the readership you could.

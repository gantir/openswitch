I envision this being a quick and lighthearted post.

I&#8217;ve really gotta hand it to vegetarians.  They don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s right to eat other animals and honestly, that&#8217;s a perfectly viable option.  What&#8217;s important to note, however, is that they&#8217;re not saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat meat&#8221; as they chow down on their steak.  They live out what they believe.

Similarly, before we criticize companies for their commercialization of Christmas, we must check our own behavior and make sure it lines up with what we say we believe.  I&#8217;m not saying that everyone who rants about the commercialization of Christmas is a hypocrite.  I&#8217;m sure many people out there in blogging-land do not buy into the materialism we see this time of year.  Those people have a right to criticize others for going into a shopping frenzy because they themselves do not.  What I am saying, however, is that we should guard against hypocrisy.  This is why I&#8217;m not ranting about materialism.  I love buying gifts . . . just like I love eating meat.

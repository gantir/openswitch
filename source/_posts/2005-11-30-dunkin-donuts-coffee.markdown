I love coffee.  Specifically, I love Dunkin&#8217; Donuts coffee.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned their coffee beats Starbucks or Caribou hands down.  Every chance I get I&#8217;ll make use of the local Dunkin&#8217; Donuts drive-thru and get myself a large coffee with cream and three sugars.  That&#8217;s what I get every time.  Not a hard order by any means.  I never order donuts (which is ironic, since it IS Dunkin&#8217; Donuts) or anything else, just coffee.  Normally, at the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts right by my house they&#8217;re really good about getting my order right.  They&#8217;re usually very fast and friendly too.  But lately I&#8217;ve been going to a new store that opened up by the church I serve at.  Every single time I go through their drive-thru I have problems with the person hearing me correctly.  Maybe I mumble, maybe it&#8217;s just their inexperience since it&#8217;s a new store, I don&#8217;t know.  Regardless, a typical conversation usually sounds like this:

Them &#8211; &#8220;Hi, can I take your order?&#8221;

Me &#8211; &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d like a large coffee with cream and three sugars.&#8221;

Them &#8211; &#8220;You want a coffee?&#8221;

Me &#8211; &#8220;Yeah, a large coffee with cream and three sugars.&#8221;

Them &#8211; &#8220;You want three sugars?&#8221;

Me &#8211; &#8220;Yes.  And cream.&#8221;

Them &#8211; &#8220;So, you want a medium coffee with cream and sugar.&#8221;

Me &#8211; &#8220;No, a large coffee.&#8221;

Them &#8211; &#8220;You want a large coffee with sugar?&#8221;

This could go on for a few days, but eventually they get my order right and say those three magical and liberating words, &#8220;Pull forward please.&#8221;  It&#8217;s amazing what I&#8217;ll put up with for a good cup of coffee, and I <em>do </em>put up with it.  Day after day after day.  I never complain to their faces.  I just give them the benefit of the doubt and politely say, &#8220;Thanks&#8221; while handing them a $1.60.

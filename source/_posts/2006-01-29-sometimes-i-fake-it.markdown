This may come as a shock to some of you, but some Sunday mornings I fake it.  I fake wanting to be there, I fake wanting to talk to people, I fake my praises.  Don&#8217;t hear me say that I dislike ministry because I love it, I can&#8217;t see myself doing anything else.  Similarly, don&#8217;t hear me say I dislike Southside Baptist Church, because they&#8217;re like family to me.  I&#8217;ve actually had a person ask me to consider coming and serving at another church as student minister but I turned them down because I love Southside so much.  What I mean by &#8220;I fake it&#8221; is just that; I fake a good attitude.


Why did I fake it today?  It all started seven days ago.  This past week I worked Sunday through Thursday engaged in the usual pastoral duties: visiting, calling, writing cards, reading, reading, studying, studying, studying.  Then Friday (which is usually my day off) I had a great, yet exhausting, time with the students at a local Fun Park for eight hours.  Saturday offered no respite because I was in charge of a children&#8217;s ministry event, a &#8220;winter celebration,&#8221; and that was even more exhausting than the student event.  So today, when I came to church I had had my fill of being around people.  All I wanted was to stay in my office and read.  Indeed, that&#8217;s just what I did up until the worship service started.  I virtually closed myself off in my office until with one minute to spare I bolted down the hallway to the platform where I sit during the morning service.


I knew that if I went into that sanctuary with time to kill I&#8217;d get caught up in a conversation filled with pleasantries. The type of pleasantries that people who only speak to each other once a week engage in.  This type of conversation, by the way, I have to prepare myself for.  It EXHAUSTS me.  Some people get energized when they spend time in situations like this.  I, however, do not.  After a bout of chatting and shaking 100+ hands in the matter of 30 minutes I have to retreat to my solitude like a recluse and recover.


I gave the morning announcements and the invocation prayer with the usual excitement in my voice, but it was faked.  I sang all the worship songs as though I&#8217;d rather be doing nothing else, faked.  After the service I shook hands and told people how good it was to see them, fake, fake.  I was faking it all.  What did I want most this morning?  To be sleeping.


&#8220;Normal&#8221; people get to choose whether or not they go to church.  If they have a cold, they don&#8217;t have to go.  If they legitimately need to catch up on their sleep, they don&#8217;t have to go.  But for me it&#8217;s not just church.  I don&#8217;t go there just to lay my worship before the Lord.  I go there to work.  I go there to earn money.  I go there to support my family.  It&#8217;s my trade.  99% of the time I love my trade.  I love it when &#8220;work&#8221; involves me taking a group of teens to Six Flags Over Georgia.  I love it when &#8220;work&#8221; means I get to go to church and am paid to be there.  But sometimes I wish I could just opt out of a Sunday here and there.  Sometimes my heart&#8217;s just not in my work.  In that way I suppose being a minister is just like any other vocation.  There are days when you love to work and there are days when you have to work.  I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t expect ministry to be any different.


In conclusion, I praise God that He&#8217;s given me the ability to work and the privilege to work for Him!  Though, perhaps we should keep in mind that any job a Christian does he should do it as if working for the Lord.  I wonder, does that mean we are to never dislike our work?  I think not.

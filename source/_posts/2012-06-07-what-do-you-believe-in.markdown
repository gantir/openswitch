I was having a conversation with a good friend today about beliefs.  I'm not talking about religion, I'm talking about believing in ourselves.  See, I believe that there's very little holding me back from accomplishing virtually anything I want.  I believe that given enough time and resources I could learn to fly a commercial jet, race in the [Iditarod](http://iditarod.com/), or build a supercomputer.  The only thing stopping me from accomplishing these feats is myself.

By and large, I owe this inner confidence in my own abilities to my dad.  I watched him as he tackled highly complex tasks by studying, researching and thinking his way through the problems.  Most of the time these tasks came in the form of vehicle repairs and home improvements, but he never ceased to amaze me in his ability to teach himself new skills and apply them.  I live my life today with the same philosophy.

When I wanted to learn how to hand code HTML and CSS, I read a lot, taught myself and implemented it.  When I wanted to follow my passion for working on computers I brought myself as far as I could and then landed a job as a computer technician.  

What's stopping me from the next thing?  Nothing.

I encourage you to think about what you believe.  Do you understand that you are the only thing standing between you and your goals, or do you believe you're powerless to change the situation in which you find yourself?

Do you believe that God is still in the business of healing physical ailments?  It&#8217;s a tough question for us all to be sure.  Go read <a title="Cerulean Sanctum: Creating a Theology from Unbelief" href="http://www.dedelen.com/2005/11/creating-theology-from-unbelief.html">this post at Cerulean Sanctum</a>.  Dan has some great thoughts and convictions regarding the issue of supernatural healing.  By the way, Dan is an <em>excellent</em> writer and a very clear thinker.  It&#8217;s a blog y&#8217;all should read regularly because even if you don&#8217;t agree with him, his posts make you think about what you believe.

While I agree with all he says regarding healing I still have reservations.  I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s trying to say that God <em>always </em>heals when the person has enough faith.  It seems like that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s saying but I may just be reading too much into it.  If that&#8217;s the case, and Dan is asserting that if a person has enough faith God will heal then I have to fundamentally disagree.  I think sometimes God chooses specifically not to heal for reasons unknown (see <a href="http://david-monreal.blogspot.com/2005/10/pacemaker-needed.html">Baby Grace</a>.)

I say this knowing full well that when I was 4 I was the recipient of divine healing after the church elders came and prayed over me, anointing me with oil on my hospital bed.  So I know that God is still in the business of supernaturally healing physical illness.  But does He <em>always </em>heal those with faith?  I&#8217;m not so sure.  It seems like that would put too many limits on God.  I suppose you could say that it&#8217;s not limiting God, that He&#8217;s just holding up his end of the deal as we see in Psalm 91.  But I&#8217;m still not positive that He promised to <em>always </em>heal those that have enough faith.

The reason I have a problem with saying <em>always</em> is because that then implies that if a person is not healed then they obviously didn&#8217;t have enough faith.  You see how I could have a problem with saying the word &#8220;always?&#8221;  Then again, maybe I&#8217;m wrong, maybe Dan isn&#8217;t saying that God will always heal when there is enough faith.  Go read the post, tell me what you think.

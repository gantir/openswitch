My son, the unintentional comedian, is learning new words at a feverish pace.  Unfortunately he&#8217;s not always able to remember which definitions go with which words.  For some time now he&#8217;s been aware of his and everyone else&#8217;s burps.  So when he burps or is within earshot of a burp his eyes widen and he exclaims, &#8220;BURP!&#8221; with such exuberance that you&#8217;d think he&#8217;d discovered a method of cold fusion.  More recently he&#8217;s discovered his own flatulence.  But instead of calling it a toot, a flutter or even a fart, after he &#8220;breaks wind&#8221; he widens his eyes, points to his posterior and belts out, &#8220;BURP!&#8221; to anyone willing to listen.  If no one is listening he&#8217;ll repeat it louder and louder until someone <em>does </em>listen.  He then proceeds to giggle at his funny body.  He&#8217;s a boy through and through.  Why do we men find our bodily functions so amusing?  I certainly don&#8217;t know the reason, but evidently it&#8217;s genetic.

Part of me wants to correct him, &#8220;no son that was a toot.&#8221;  But the other part of me finds this mistake too darn adorable to educate into oblivion.  Besides, he essentially correct.   Isn&#8217;t a fart very similar to a burp from your butt?  Well, doctors may disagree, but to a 2 year-old it makes perfect sense to use the same word to refer to these two bodily functions.  I never thought farting and burping could be cute until I heard those otherwise gross sounds come out of my son. And I NEVER thought I would be able to tolerate somone farting on my lap!

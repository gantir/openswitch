Thomas almost broke my heart this morning.? He has developed a morning routine that simply involves waking up and eating breakfast while watching Sesame Street.? This morning was no different, he was sitting on my wife&#8217;s lap, eating some cereal and watching his show when it came time for me to leave for work.? Normally, this is when he would start crying and holding out his hands for me to pick him up.? This, ironically, would make me feel both good and bad.? I felt bad for leaving him yet I still felt wanted by him.? This morning, however, was not normal.? Instead of crying and being sad at seeing me go he casually looked at me, said &#8220;bye bye&#8221;, waved his hand once and unemotionally went back to watching Elmo skitch across the TV screen.? I didn&#8217;t see it coming, it made me almost cry!? &#8220;My son doesn&#8217;t need me anymore&#8221; was all I could think as I walked out the door.? I know, I know, he still really does need me.? It was just weird to see him be OK with me leaving.? My little boy is growing up so fast!

I don&#8217;t know if this is national news but here in Georgia it&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HUGE</span></span></span></span>.  Recently a <a title="Woman Charged With Molesting 15-Year-Old" href="http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/stories/20051115/localnews/37821.shtml">37-year-old woman, Lynnette Clark, was arrested for molesting a 15-year-old boy</a>.  Oh, did I mention they are <em>married</em>?  Yeah, Lynnette is pregnant with the boy&#8217;s baby too.   In Georgia (please hold the redneck jokes) a teen can get married if the woman is pregnant.  So, some dim-wit judge reasoned that since Lynnette is obviously pregnant it&#8217;s OK to marry the 37-year-old and the 15-year-old (in his own driveway, nonetheless.)  Even now he insists he did nothing wrong.  Unfortunately, he overlooked the fact that a 15-year-old can&#8217;t consent to having sex.  So this is basically a pregnancy resulting from a rape.  All I know of the story is that Lynnette has a son that&#8217;s about 15 as well and the two boys would frequently play together.  Now that&#8217;s just sickening.  How can this woman be attracted to a boy the same age as her son?  I can&#8217;t fathom it.  My heart breaks most for the unborn baby; what a life to be born into.

Anyway, Lynnette is in jail pending trial.  I think she&#8217;s lucky to be alive because if the sexes were reversed and a 37-year-old man got a 15-year-old girl pregnant he would likely be shot on the way to trial like Lee Harvey Oswald.
